Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world. It has primarily consumed due to its stimulant effect and unique taste since the ancient times.

It contains many bioactive compounds such as caffeine, chlorogenic acids and diterpenoid alcohols which have so far been associated with many potential health benefits. For example, caffeine reduces risk of developing neurodegenerative disease and chlorogenic acids (CGA) and diterpene alcohols have many health benefits such as antioxidant and chemo-preventive. Coffee also have harmful effects. For example, diterpenoid alcohols increases serum homocysteine and cholesterol levels and thus it has adverse effects on cardiovascular system. Overall, the study that supports the health benefits of coffee is increasing.

Input:
Databricks SQL Serverless supports serverless compute. Admins can create serverless SQL warehouses (formerly SQL endpoints) that enable instant compute and are managed by Databricks. Serverless SQL warehouses use compute clusters in your Databricks account. Use them with Databricks SQL queries just like you normally would with the original customer-hosted SQL warehouses, which are now called classic SQL warehouses. Databricks changed the name from SQL endpoint to SQL warehouse because, in the industry, endpoint refers to either a remote computing device that communicates with a network that it’s connected to, or an entry point to a cloud service. A data warehouse is a data management system that stores current and historical data from multiple sources in a business friendly manner for easier insights and reporting. SQL warehouse accurately describes the full capabilities of this compute resource. If serverless SQL warehouses are enabled for your account, note the following: New SQL warehouses are serverless by default when you create them from the UI. New SQL warehouses are not serverless by default when you create them using the API, which requires that you explicitly specify serverless. You can also create new pro or classic SQL warehouses using either method. You can upgrade a pro or classic SQL warehouse to a serverless SQL warehouse or a classic SQL warehouse to a pro SQL warehouse. You can also downgrade from serverless to pro or classic. This feature only affects Databricks SQL. It does not affect how Databricks Runtime clusters work with notebooks and jobs in the Data Science & Engineering or Databricks Machine Learning workspace environments. Databricks Runtime clusters always run in the classic data plane in your AWS account. See Serverless quotas. If your account needs updated terms of use, workspace admins are prompted in the Databricks SQL UI. If your workspace has an AWS instance profile, you might need to update the trust relationship to support serverless compute, depending on how and when it was created.""",

Input:
I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with the iPhone 14 Pro Max that I recently purchased. As a long-time Apple user and loyal customer, I was excited to upgrade to the latest and greatest iPhone model, but unfortunately, my experience with this device has been nothing short of a nightmare.
Firstly, I would like to address the issue of battery life on this device. I was under the impression that Apple had made significant improvements to their battery technology, but unfortunately, this has not been my experience. Despite using the phone conservatively, I find that I have to charge it at least twice a day just to ensure it doesn't die on me when I need it the most. This is extremely inconvenient and frustrating, especially when I have to carry around a bulky power bank or constantly hunt for charging outlets.
Moreover, I have encountered numerous issues with the software and hardware of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The phone frequently freezes or crashes, and I have experienced several instances of apps crashing or not working properly. The phone also takes an unacceptably long time to start up, and I find myself waiting for several minutes before I can even use it. As someone who relies on their phone for both personal and professional purposes, this is incredibly frustrating and has caused me to miss important calls and messages.
Furthermore, I am extremely disappointed with the camera quality on this device. Despite Apple's claims of improved camera technology, I have found that the photos I take on this phone are often blurry or grainy, and the colors are not as vibrant as I would like. This is especially disappointing considering the high price point of the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which is marketed as a premium smartphone with a top-of-the-line camera.
In addition, I am disappointed with the lack of innovation and new features on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. For a phone that is marketed as the "next big thing," it feels like a minor upgrade from the previous model. The design is virtually unchanged, and the new features that have been added, such as 5G connectivity and the A16 Bionic chip, are not significant enough to justify the high price point of this device. I expected more from Apple, a company that prides itself on innovation and creativity.
Furthermore, the customer service experience that I have had with Apple has been less than satisfactory. I have tried reaching out to Apple support numerous times, but have been met with unhelpful and dismissive responses. The representatives that I spoke with seemed to be more interested in closing the case quickly than actually addressing my concerns and finding a solution to my problems. This has left me feeling frustrated and unheard, and I do not feel like my concerns have been taken seriously.
Overall, I feel as though I have been let down by Apple and their latest iPhone offering. As a loyal customer who has invested a significant amount of money into their products over the years, I expect better from a company that prides itself on innovation and customer satisfaction. I urge Apple to take these concerns seriously and make necessary improvements to the iPhone 14 Pro Max and future models.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.""",
