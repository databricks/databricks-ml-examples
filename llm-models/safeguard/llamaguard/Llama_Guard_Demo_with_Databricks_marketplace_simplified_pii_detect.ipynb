    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT** The Llama Guard integration is in **Private Preview**. To enroll in the Private Preview, reach out to your Databricks account team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta's [Purple LLaMA](https://ai.meta.com/blog/purple-llama-open-trust-safety-generative-ai/) project has introduced Llama Guard, a robust 7 billion parameter model designed for chat moderation. This innovative model, comprehensively detailed in its [model card](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b), plays a pivotal role in enhancing the safety and quality of interactions with conversational AI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- At Databricks/MosaicML, our commitment to responsible AI adoption is underscored by integrating tools like Llama Guard. We are excited to announce the availability of a demo Llama Guard endpoint at `https://models.hosted-on.mosaicml.hosting/llamaguard-7b/v2/chat`. This endpoint is readily accessible to the global AI community and does not require any authorization. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explore the demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive demo enables you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Engage with Llama Guard**: Utilize the model for effective prompt and response filtering, ensuring a safer chat experience.\n",
    "2. **Custom taxonomy configuration**: Seamlessly define and implement your own taxonomy criteria specific to your needs with Llama Guard.\n",
    "3. **Comprehensive integration**: Establish a robust end-to-end safety pipeline by integrating Llama Guard with your chat model, enhancing overall model performance and user safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before continuing through this notebook you are required to go this [link](/marketplace/consumer/listings/9cd61515-663a-4d71-b1a7-758458b68dff) and click on  `Get instant access`. This allows you to accept the terms of service of the model providers and register the model in a UC catalog. \n",

      "💛 Loving others can bring great joy and fulfillment to your life. Here are some ways to cultivate love:\n\n1. Practice self-love: Before you can love others, it's essential to love yourself. Treat yourself with kindness, compassion, and respect. Engage in activities that nourish your mind, body, and spirit.\n\n2. Listen actively: Pay attention to what others are saying and show genuine interest in their thoughts and feelings. By doing so, you demonstrate that you value and care for them.\n\n3. Show empathy: Try to understand others' perspectives and experiences. This can help build stronger connections and foster a sense of belonging.\n\n4. Perform acts of kindness: Small gestures, such as holding the door open for someone or offering a compliment, can make a significant difference in someone's day.\n\n5. Communicate openly and honestly: Share your thoughts and feelings with others in a respectful and considerate manner. This can help build trust and deepen relationships.\n\n6. Spend quality time: Dedicate time to those you care about. Engage in activities that you both enjoy and cherish the moments you share together.\n\n7. Cultivate gratitude: Regularly express appreciation for the people and things in your life. This can help foster a positive mindset and strengthen relationships.\n\n8. Seek help when needed: If you're struggling to love or feel loved, consider seeking support from a mental health professional. They can provide guidance and tools to help you navigate your emotions and relationships.\n\nRemember, love is a journey, not a destination. Be patient with yourself and others as you cultivate and nurture loving relationships. 💛\n"
